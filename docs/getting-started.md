# Getting Started

## Your First MVL Program

Create `hello.mvl`:

```mvl
fn main() -> Unit ! Console {
    println("Hello, verified world!")
}
```

Run it:

```bash
mvl run hello.mvl
# Hello, verified world!
```

The `! Console` declares that this function has a console side effect. MVL tracks all effects in function signatures — nothing is hidden.

## Your First Verification

Create `positive.mvl`:

```mvl
fn double(x: Int where x > 0) -> Int where self > 0 {
    x * 2
}

fn main() -> Unit ! Console {
    let result: Int = double(5);
    println(result.to_string())
}
```

Check it:

```bash
mvl check positive.mvl
# ✓ All 11 requirements verified
```

The compiler **proves** at compile time that:

- `double(5)` satisfies `x > 0` (refinement type)
- The return value satisfies `self > 0` (return refinement)
- `result` is always positive — no runtime check needed

Try breaking it:

```mvl
fn main() -> Unit ! Console {
    let result: Int = double(-1);  // ← compile error!
}
```

```
error[REQ10]: refinement violated
  --> positive.mvl:7:30
   |
7  |     let result: Int = double(-1);
   |                              ^^ value -1 does not satisfy `x > 0`
```

## Assurance Report

```bash
mvl assurance positive.mvl --verbose
```

This generates a verification report showing which requirements were proven, how many proofs were discharged, and the evidence trail. Useful for compliance (DO-178C, IEC 61508, ISO 26262).

## Complete Example

### Requirements Demonstrated

| Req | Name | How It's Shown |
|-----|------|----------------|
| 3 | No Null | `Option[Int]`, `Result[Int, String]` — explicit handling required |
| 5 | Bounds Safety | `for i in 0..n` with `n <= amounts.len()` — compiler proves access is safe |
| 6 | Ownership | Values consumed, no aliasing of `from`/`to` possible |
| 8 | Termination | `partial fn` + `while` vs `total fn` + `for` with `decreases` clause |
| 9 | Effect Tracking | `! Console` declared — `log_info`/`log_error` calls are tracked |
| 10 | Refinement Types | `amount > 0`, `balance >= 0`, `n <= amounts.len()` — proven at compile time |
| 11 | Information Flow | `Secret[String]` blocked from Console; `relabel trust()` with audit tag |

### Key Patterns

**Totality and loops:**

- `partial fn` + `while`: No termination guarantee — compiler accepts but doesn't prove termination
- `total fn` + `for`: Bounded iteration with `decreases` clause — compiler proves termination

**Information Flow Control:**

- `Secret[String]` cannot flow to any effect (Console, FileWrite, Net)
- `relabel trust(secret, "audit_tag")` crosses the IFC boundary
- The audit tag appears in the assurance report — every trust boundary is documented

**The commented line `// log_info(account_id)` would be a compile-time error:**

```
error[E0011]: information flow violation
  --> banking.mvl:32:9
   |
32 |         log_info(account_id)
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Secret[String] cannot flow to effect Console
   |
   = help: use `relabel trust(account_id, "reason")` to cross the boundary
   = note: this will be recorded in the assurance report
```
